# Temperature to saturation vapor pressure

Converts temperature to saturation vapor pressure

## Temperature to saturation vapor pressure of water for temperature > 0°C

Formula which converts temperature to saturation vapor pressure of water ($t>0°C$):

$$
  \huge{P_s = \frac{{\rm e}^{(34.494-\frac{4924.99}{t+237.1})}}{(t+105)^{1.57}}}
$$

where

- $P_s$ - saturation vapor pressure [P]
- $t$ - temperature [°C]

## Temperature to saturation vapor pressure of ice for temperature <= 0°C

Formula which converts temperature to saturation vapor pressure of ice ($t<=0°C$):

$$
  \huge{P_s = \frac{{\rm e}^{(43.494-\frac{6545.8}{t+278})}}{(t+868)}^2}
$$

where

- $P_s$ - saturation vapor pressure [P]
- $t$ - temperature [°C]
